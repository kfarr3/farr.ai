Interest rate to chance, % above the Market, (S&P, Dow, etc)\
Risk goes down with understanding\
What do you know that other investors don't know?  That's your stragety

How much accounting/business to learn

Read the 13F from successful investors, calculate their return\
Research good companies, get first-hand experience reading financials from good companies and try to understand why they are good\
Compare with companies loosing money, look for pre-downturn markers\
Research how to protect your capital while chasing better than market returns

Maintain a list of companies with good numbers, waiting for them to have a down-turn.

Before buying, set up a checklist of requirements, when a stock looses value, revisit the checklist and determine if the market or myself made a mistake\
Have an exist plan for each stock purchased, exit up and exit down.  If a company is massively overvalued, does it make sense to capitalize on that and repurchase when the market makes a correction?
